#Method to collect word from user number 1
  #input: string
  #method will accept the string and split it into an array so each letter in the word is indexed.
  #output: an array of letters not accessible to user

#Method to replace word with a _ for each letter in the word
  #input: integer
  #method will accept string.length and create a new array
  #output: an array where strings letters are replaced with _.  User needs to see this.

#Method to check for letters
  #input: string (letter)
  #method will check the first array for the letter the user provides.  If  that letter is present in that array, letter needs to replace _ at the same index in the _ _ _ array.
  #output: updated array either with letter if letter appeared, or without  letter if it was not present in first array.

#While loop
  #While number of guesses is less than or equal to the string length, allow user to keep guessing letters.
  #When number of guesses is greater than string length, game is over.
  #if user guesses letter that they've already guessed, do not count as a guess.
