    <h1>Who run the world? Cats</h1>
    <p>My love for cats is one that began relatively recently.  I grew up with dogs and didn't know my affinity for the feline friend until a few years ago.</p>
    <h2>Reasons Cats Rock</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They are incredibly intelligent</li>
      <li>They sleep on your pillow at night</li>
      <li>They greet you at the door when they get home</li>
      <li>They help relieve <a target=_blank href="http://pets.thenest.com/can-stroking-cats-fur-relieve-stress-8220.html">stress</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this point in my life, I'm comfortable calling myself a <strong>cat person</strong>. I have two very large tabby cats.  One <em>orange</em> one, and one <em>gray</em> one.</p>
