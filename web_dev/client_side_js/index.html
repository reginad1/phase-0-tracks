			<li><strong>Cauliflower</strong></li>
			<p>Cauliflower is a fantastic summer vegetable.  It is great in stir frys, in smoothies, and can even be used a gluten free substitute for pizza crust.</p>
			<li><strong>Tomatoes</strong></li>
			<p>Tomatoes are the red shining star of every summer.  Tomato sandwiches with homemade mayo, a little salt and pepper are the best thing ever.  Use tomatoes in salads, or make a big batch of tomato sauce to save for pasta and pizza later on!</p>
			<li><strong>Cucumbers</strong></li>
			<p>Cucumbers fresh from the garden are one of the most delectable things a person can eat on a hot summer day.  Toss some slices into a jug of ice water for a refreshing pick-me-up in the afternoon, or along side some tomatoes and feta for a fresh snack or side dish.</p>
