A bit about Linux design philosophies:

According to David Both, one of the key design philosophies of Linux operating
systems is that the user knows what they are doing.  The command line 
interface is easily accessible from a Linux operating system.  This Linux 
philosophy came from the Unix philosophy, which when designed in the 60's
or 70's, was that the creators assumed that the users would be 'computer 
literate' and know how to interact with the command line.  Both argues that 
where other operating systems are elitist, hiding their CMI behind a graphical
user interface, Linux is egalitarian presenting the CMI front and center.  

Another interesting facet of the Linux operating system is that it is 
developed by groups of volunteers on the Internet.  This means anyone can 
contribute to development or debugging.  It is often described as being an operating system for hackers or developers. 


VPS:
A VPS or a virtual private server is a virtual hosting environment that looks
to the user like a dedicated server.  In order to host your website online,
you need to have your files available on a server.  
One of the main benefits of using a VPS is that subscriber has unrestricted 
access to the VPS, giving you control over your server, without using middle
man.  It also can provide privacy.
