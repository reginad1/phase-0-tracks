Common HTTP Status Codes:

200 OK
As mentioned in the video, a 200 http status code is indication that the request has succeeded.

300 Multiple Choices
This status code indicates that the request has different choices and cannot be "resolved into one"

302 Found
302 Found means that the requested resource resides under a different URI temporarily.

403 Forbidden
This means that the server understood the request but will not allow the request to be fulfilled. 

404 Not Found 
This http status code means 'not found' so the server cannot find anything that matches that request.  There is no indication whether this is a permanent or temporary. 

Difference between GET and POST:
Both get and post are two methods to request connection between clients and servers.  GET requests can be cached, remain in the browser history, and can be bookmarked, whereas POST requests cannot be cached, cannot remain in the browser history, and cannot be bookmarked.  Using the back button or reload button is harmless when using GET requests.  When POST requests are used, the user will be notified that data will be lost when using back or reload. POST methods are used when a higher level of security is needed because GET requests should not be used when dealing with sensitive data.  I think POST request methods are used when you have to enter payment information to purchase something, or other times when sensitive material is being used. 

Cookies:
Cookies are just a type of message given to a browser by a server.  Their primary purpose is to identify users and potentially prepare customized web pages.  They can also save site login information.  Web servers have no memory of their own, which is where cookies come in.  Apparently, cookies help transfer info from the browser to your computer's hard disk. 

session cookies: this is a cookie that is erased when you close your web browser.  It's stored in temporary memory, but not remembered after you close your browser.  

persistent cookies: a cookie that is stored on your hard drive until it expires or until you delete it.
