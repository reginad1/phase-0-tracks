How I will learn jquery:

I am going to time-block myself, within this already time-blocked challenge.
First: I am going to spend 30 minutes reading through and perhaps 
experimenting with some things from Jon Duckett's Javascript & Jquery book.
I assume that with my time restraint, I'll be able to get through at least 
the first two chapters pertaining to jquery.  

Then I'm headed over to W3Schools, and start at the beginning and work 
through as many of their tutorials as I can for the next hour and 30 
minutes.  

As I am doing each of these things, I am going to have the chameleon html 
page open to hopefully experiment a bit with things as I go.  I am going to 
take one ten minute break at the end of the first hour. And....go!

Reflecting on learning jquery in two hours:

I did stray a little from my plan.  I started out by spending thirty minutes reading about jquery in the Jon Duckett book as I planned.  This was helpful to get a grasp on the syntax, but did not exactly help me understand how to include jquery in an html file or how to download it.

Because I was unsure of exactly how to get jquery to work, I went ahead and made a practice html document.  Generally I learn things better when I can dive in and see things working, like in the browser with html, or in irb with ruby.  After making an html document, I watched a short youtube video(I think it was literally 9 minutes) about the power of jquery, how to install it and how to include it in your html file.  From there I went to W3School and went through a few of their tutorials.  I like their "try it yourself" button where you can see how jquery is interacting with html.  I coded along with the try it yourself in my own documents so I could keep the html code separate from the javascript file containing jquery.  

After practicing with the tutorials, I continued playing with a grocery list that I created when I was reading during the first thirty minutes.  I ended up scrolling through the w3school to figure out how to do specific things (like add an item to a list) but then would google if I came across any problems.  This all served as a pretty good way to play with jquery.  

All of this being said, I would not want to take a closed note test on jquery any time soon :) It is clear I still have a lot to learn!
