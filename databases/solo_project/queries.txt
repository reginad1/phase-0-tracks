1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM houses;
1|Log Turner|45|true|2
2|Lego House|30|true|2
3|Woolvine House|5|true|2
4|Farn House|32|true|3
5|John's House|20|false|1
6|Lottie's House|15|true|1


Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE houses SET name="Reggie's House" WHERE name="Lottie's House";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM houses;
1|Log Turner|45|true|2
2|Lego House|30|true|2
3|Woolvine House|5|true|2
4|Farn House|32|true|3
5|John's House|20|false|1
6|Reggie's House|15|true|1


Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM houses, streets WHERE houses.streets_id = streets.id;
1|Log Turner|45|true|2|2|Progress Street
2|Lego House|30|true|2|2|Progress Street
3|Woolvine House|5|true|2|2|Progress Street
4|Farn House|32|true|3|3|Main Street
5|John's House|20|false|1|1|Virginia Street
6|Reggie's House|15|true|1|1|Virginia Street


Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.


SELECT houses.name, houses.age, houses.is_cool_house, streets.name FROM houses JOIN streets ON houses.streets_id = streets.id;
Log Turner|45|true|Progress Street
Lego House|30|true|Progress Street
Woolvine House|5|true|Progress Street
Farn House|32|true|Main Street
John's House|20|false|Virginia Street
Reggie's House|15|true|Virginia Street


Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).


DELETE FROM houses WHERE is_cool_house="false";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM houses;
1|Log Turner|45|true|2
2|Lego House|30|true|2
3|Woolvine House|5|true|2
4|Farn House|32|true|3
6|Reggie's House|15|true|1


RELEASE 3 Join statements:

INNER JOIN:

SELECT houses.name, houses.age, streets.name FROM houses INNER JOIN streets on houses.streets_id = streets.id;
Log Turner|45|Progress Street
Lego House|30|Progress Street
Woolvine House|5|Progress Street
Farn House|32|Main Street
Reggie's House|15|Virginia Street

** this join combines the two tables where the tables intersect.  In this case it is at the houses.streets_id and the street id.

LEFT JOIN:

SELECT houses.name, streets.name FROM houses LEFT JOIN streets ON houses.streets_id = streets.id;
Log Turner|Progress Street
Lego House|Progress Street
Woolvine House|Progress Street
Farn House|Main Street
John's House|Virginia Street
Reggie's House|Virginia Street

RIGHT JOIN:

select houses.name, streets.name FROM houses RIGHT JOIN streets ON houses.streets_id = streets.id;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

** I believe I'm getting this error because the streets table does not have a foreign key for the houses..
